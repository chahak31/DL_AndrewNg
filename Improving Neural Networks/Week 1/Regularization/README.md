## Problem Statement: You have just been hired as an AI expert by the French Football Corporation. They would like you to recommend positions where France's goal keeper should kick the ball so that the French team's players can then hit it with their head.

### Each dot corresponds to a position on the football field where a football player has hit the ball with his/her head after the French goal keeper has shot the ball from the left side of the football field.
### If the dot is blue, it means the French player managed to hit the ball with his/her head
### If the dot is red, it means the other team's player hit the ball with their head
## Your goal: Use a deep learning model to find the positions on the field where the goalkeeper should kick the ball.Â¶
